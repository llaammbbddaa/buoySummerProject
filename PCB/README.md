## PCB INFO
because we had already developed the entire thing on an arduino breadboard combo
switching things over to fritzing for pcb development was incredibly simple
i also found that labelling what things went where (input / output) made things infinitely similar
and i would strongly advise people to add that in the comments of their code (assumming that this isnt just common practice)

## MISC DETAILS
there should at least be a pdf of the pcb that we designed
its fairly simple, and just helps to support and compact all of the sensors and arduino
it makes the most sense to use a manufactured pcb because we are short on space
